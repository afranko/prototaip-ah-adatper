Welcome to arrowhead-client's documentation!
############################################

This is the documentation for the ``arrowhead_client`` Python library, which enables you to use Python to design and
test Eclipse-Arrowhead compliant clients with little overhead and trouble.

.. warning::

    This library is still in alpha and **no APIs are considered stable**.
    Each new update might produce breaking changes, though the current public API of the :py:class:`~arrowhead_client.client.ArrowheadClient` has been stable for some time (with some naming changes) and no changes to it are planned.
    All other APIs are provisional and will likely change more than once before version 1.0 of the library.

Click :ref:`eclipse-arrowhead` to learn more about the framework, it's components, and the philosophy behind it,
with some useful links to other resources.

Click :ref:`quickstart` if you just want to get started testing the client library.

Click :ref:`user-guide` to learn how to use the framework, with a focus on how things are used.

Click :ref:`api-reference` for a detailed view of all modules, classes and functions available in this library.
